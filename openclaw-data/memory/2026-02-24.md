## 2026-02-24 Evening Updates (durable)
- Mission-control web repo confirmed at `/home/user/mission-control-test`; updated Agents/dashboard structure for mail high/low model split and pushed to `origin/master` (commit `dfd4cd5`).
- Removed mistakenly created workspace docs (`AGENT_ORG_MAIL_SYSTEM.md`, `README.md`) after user correction.
- Applied OpenClaw config patch to add NAVER IMAP env vars and restarted gateway:
  - `NAVER_IMAP_USER=jimmygu`
  - `NAVER_IMAP_PASS=QKX8ZWW8DJRN`
  - `NAVER_IMAP_HOST=imap.naver.com`
  - `NAVER_IMAP_PORT=993`
- Cron hardening done for `mail-orchestrator:am:v2` and `mail-orchestrator:pm:v2`:
  - enforce `python3` only (no `python`)
  - add precheck `command -v python3`
- Forced rerun of `mail-orchestrator:pm:v2` succeeded after timeout retry.
- On user-approved delete action: IMAP trash move executed for some Daum items (`정산금액 입금 완료 안내입니다.` x2, `[스마트스토어] 주문현황...` x1); Gmail matched 0 in this run.
- New planned project direction confirmed: Naver SmartStore review-reply workflow should be browser-control based (no API), with Telegram approval gate before actual posting.
- Browser relay check: Chrome profile connected and SmartStore tab detected, but later browser control service timed out; user may need `openclaw gateway restart` to continue live UI test.
- User preference update: likes fromis_9 Song Hayoung style/tone references.
- Company context to remember: user’s company is MadeAll (madeall3d), a 3D-printing-centered business; avoid confusion with similarly named companies.
